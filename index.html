        <p class="about-text">
          Agatha Christie was an English writer known for her 66 detective
          novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving
          around fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. She also
          wrote the world's longest-running play, The Mousetrap, which was
          performed in the West End from 1952 to 2020, as well as six novels
          under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame
          (DBE) for her contributions to literature. Guinness World Records
          lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her
          novels having sold more than two billion copies.
